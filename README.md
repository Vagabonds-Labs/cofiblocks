# **CofiBlocks - La Comunidad del Caf√© ‚òïÔ∏è**

CofiBlocks is the first Collaborative Business connecting traditional coffee-growing communities in Costa Rica and worldwide directly with coffee lovers using Starknet blockchain technology. Our mission is to distribute benefits among all members, ensuring fair trade, community engagement, and technological innovation.

CofiBlocks se presenta como el primer Negocio Colaborativo que conecta a las comunidades tradicionales productoras de caf√© en Costa Rica, y en todo el mundo, directamente con los amantes del caf√© utilizando la tecnolog√≠a blockchain Starknet. Nuestra misi√≥n es distribuir beneficios entre todos los miembros, asegurando el comercio justo, la participaci√≥n de la comunidad y la innovaci√≥n tecnol√≥gica.
## üåç **What is a Collaborative Business?**

A Collaborative Business is an organization where customers, producers, and supporters become members. These members share responsibility, decision-making, and benefits (both monetary and otherwise). Our model represents an evolution of the cooperative and DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) concepts, leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts, and crypto assets (such as NFTs and social currencies).

## üìå **Crucial concepts**

1. **Collaborative Business**

A model where multiple parties (individuals or companies) collaborate to create, operate, and benefit from a project or product. It relies on decentralization, shared decision-making, and fair profit distribution.

2. **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**

Unique digital assets based on blockchain, used to represent ownership of digital or physical items like art, music, or contracts. They are immutable, verifiable, and not directly interchangeable like cryptocurrencies.


3. **COFI Tokens**

Digital assets serving as the unit of value and participation within the CofiBlocks ecosystem. Likely used for transactions, incentives, and governance in the project.

## üåü **How Does It Work?**

- ### Cofi in Your Home
```
Subscribers receive freshly roasted coffee delivered to their doorsteps monthly, ensuring they enjoy the finest brews while supporting local producers.
```

- ### Cofi is Fair
```
Producers receive fair payments upfront, allowing them to plan and understand demand ahead of time, thanks to our subscription model.
```

- ### Cofi Art & NFTs
```
In its pilot year, CofiBlocks will create a collection of NFTs featuring original artwork, distributed via coffee labels on each bag sold.
```

- ### Cofi Complementary Currency
```
Members of the CofiBlocks pilot community on the Cambiatus app can claim their COFI tokens‚Äîa complementary blockchain currency that ensures participation in the Collaborative Business's benefits.
```

- ### Cofi Distribution

```
At the end of the first year, all CofiBlocks members will receive a percentage of the pilot's financial results in cryptocurrency based on their accumulated COFI tokens. Members will also have the opportunity to participate in decision-making for future stages of the project.
```



## üöÄ Roadmap

### **2022-2023 Season**
Thank you to everyone who participated in our first season and enjoyed coffee from the slopes of Volc√°n Po√°s.

### **2024-2025 Season**
We are preparing to launch our second season, featuring coffee from additional coffee-growing regions of Costa Rica.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (>= 18)
- Bun package manager (bun@1.1.24)
- Prisma

### **Installation**


1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vagabonds-Labs/marketplace.git
   cd marketplace
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Rename
   ```bash
   mv .env.example to .env 
   ```

4. Generate the Prisma client:

   bun prisma generate
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   bun turbo dev
   ```

**Make sure the values in the .env file are configured correctly for your environment.**


### **Project Structure**

The project is organized using workspaces:

- `apps/` - Contains the main web application.
- `packages/` - Shared packages and utilities.

Key scripts include:

- `build`: Build the project.
- `dev`: Start the development server.
- `db:migrate`: Apply database migrations.
- `db:seed`: Seed the database with initial data.

### **Key Technologies**

1. **StarkNet**
   ```bash
   StarkNet is a decentralized, permissionless Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. It uses ZK-STARKs (zero-knowledge proofs) to enable fast and cost-efficient transactions while ensuring security and scalability. Developers can deploy smart contracts, and users benefit from significantly reduced gas fees compared to Ethereum's mainnet.
   ```
2. **Prisma**
   ```bash
   Prisma is a modern database toolkit for Node.js and TypeScript. It provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that simplifies working with databases, allowing developers to define models and query data in a type-safe way. Prisma supports multiple databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB
   ```
3. **Bun**
   ```bash
   Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime that competes with Node.js and Deno. It‚Äôs built for performance and includes a fast bundler, transpiler, and package manager. Bun aims to speed up development workflows, reduce dependency on third-party tools, and execute JavaScript and TypeScript quickly. It‚Äôs designed to handle server-side apps, scripts, and front-end tooling.
   ```

## üìù **Contributing**

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how you can help:

1. **Clone and Fork Repo**: Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to create a copy of the repository under your account.

    - <a href="https://github.com/Vagabonds-Labs/cofiblocks" target="_blank"> HERE</a>

#

2. **Clone the Fork:** 
    - Clone the forked repository to your local machine by running the following command:

    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   ```

    - Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with your GitHub username and the repository name.

#

3. **Create a new branch or use the main branch:** When modifying contracts kindly make sure the formatting is correct and all tests pass successfully.

    - Create a branch name based on the type of change (e.g., `feat/name-related-issue`, `docs/name-related-issue`).

    ```
    git checkout -b branch-name
    ```
    - One of ideas on how to implement it for the branch name:

        > `docs/update-readme` or `fix/bottom-bug`.

#

4. **Commit:** Commit your changes.

    1. **git add (file-name)**
    2. **git commit -m "[type] description"**

    - Example: 
    ```
    `git add Create_Documentation`

    `git commit -m "[docs]: update documentation"`
    ```

#

5. **Push fork:** Push to your fork and submit a pull request on our `main` branch. Please provide us with some explanation of why you made the changes you made. For new features make sure to explain a standard use case to us.

- Push your changes to your forked repository:
    ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
   > Replace `your-branch-name` with the name of your branch.

- Example: 

    ```bash
    `git push origin fix/bug-fix`
    ```

#

6. **Submit a Pull Request:** Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the Semaphore Stellar SDK repository.

    - <a href="https://github.com/Vagabonds-Labs/cofiblocks/pulls" target="_blank"> Summit pull request</a>

# **üìÅ Commits**

You can do a regular commit by following the next:

``` [type] significant message ```

- <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/" target="_blank">Learn more about conventional commits</a>

### Type

**The type must be one of the following:**

- feat: A new feature.
- fix: A bug fix.
- docs: Documentation only changes.
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (improvements of the code structure).
- perf: A code change that improves the performance.
- test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests.
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, npm).
- ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: travis, circle).
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files.
- revert: Reverts a previous commit.

# **üîó Branches**
1. There must be a `main` branch, used only for the releases.
2. Avoid long descriptive names for long-lived branches.
3. Use kebab-case (no CamelCase).
4. Use grouping tokens (words) at the beginning of your branch names (in a similar way to the `type` of commit).
5. Define and use short lead tokens to differentiate branches in a way that is meaningful to your workflow.
6. Use slashes to separate parts of your branch names.
7. Remove your branch after merging it if it is not important.
**Examples:**
```
git branch -b docs/readme
git branch -b test/a-feature
git branch -b feat/sidebar
git branch -b fix/b-feature
```
