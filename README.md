## üõ†Ô∏è **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (>= 18)
- Bun package manager (bun@1.1.24)
- Prisma

### **Installation**


1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vagabonds-Labs/marketplace.git
   cd marketplace
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Rename
   ```bash
   mv .env.example to .env 
   ```

4. Generate the Prisma client:
   ```bash
   bun prisma generate
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   bun turbo dev
   ```

**Make sure the values in the .env file are configured correctly for your environment.**


### **Project Structure**

The project is organized using workspaces:

- `apps/` - Contains the main web application.
- `packages/` - Shared packages and utilities.

Key scripts include:

- `build`: Build the project.
- `dev`: Start the development server.
- `db:migrate`: Apply database migrations.
- `db:seed`: Seed the database with initial data.

### **Key Technologies**

1. **StarkNet**
   ```bash
   StarkNet is a decentralized, permissionless Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. It uses ZK-STARKs (zero-knowledge proofs) to enable fast and cost-efficient transactions while ensuring security and scalability. Developers can deploy smart contracts, and users benefit from significantly reduced gas fees compared to Ethereum's mainnet.
   ```
2. **Prisma**
   ```bash
   Prisma is a modern database toolkit for Node.js and TypeScript. It provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that simplifies working with databases, allowing developers to define models and query data in a type-safe way. Prisma supports multiple databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB
   ```
3. **Bun**
   ```bash
   Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime that competes with Node.js and Deno. It‚Äôs built for performance and includes a fast bundler, transpiler, and package manager. Bun aims to speed up development workflows, reduce dependency on third-party tools, and execute JavaScript and TypeScript quickly. It‚Äôs designed to handle server-side apps, scripts, and front-end tooling.
   ```

## üìù **Contributing**

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how you can help:

1. **Clone and Fork Repo**: Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to create a copy of the repository under your account.

    - <a href="https://github.com/Vagabonds-Labs/cofiblocks" target="_blank"> HERE</a>

#

2. **Clone the Fork:** 
    - Clone the forked repository to your local machine by running the following command:

    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   ```

    - Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with your GitHub username and the repository name.

#

3. **Create a new branch or use the main branch:** When modifying contracts kindly make sure the formatting is correct and all tests pass successfully.

    - Create a branch name based on the type of change (e.g., `feat/name-related-issue`, `docs/name-related-issue`).

    ```
    git checkout -b branch-name
    ```
    - One of ideas on how to implement it for the branch name:

        > `docs/update-readme` or `fix/bottom-bug`.

#

4. **Commit:** Commit your changes.

    1. **git add (file-name)**
    2. **git commit -m "[type] description"**

    - Example: 
    ```
    `git add Create_Documentation`

    `git commit -m "[docs]: update documentation"`
    ```

#

5. **Push fork:** Push to your fork and submit a pull request on our `main` branch. Please provide us with some explanation of why you made the changes you made. For new features make sure to explain a standard use case to us.

- Push your changes to your forked repository:
    ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
   > Replace `your-branch-name` with the name of your branch.

- Example: 

    ```bash
    `git push origin fix/bug-fix`
    ```

#

6. **Submit a Pull Request:** Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the Semaphore Stellar SDK repository.

    - <a href="https://github.com/Vagabonds-Labs/cofiblocks/pulls" target="_blank"> Summit pull request</a>

# **üìÅ Commits**

You can do a regular commit by following the next:

``` [type] significant message ```

- <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/" target="_blank">Learn more about conventional commits</a>

### Type

**The type must be one of the following:**

- feat: A new feature.
- fix: A bug fix.
- docs: Documentation only changes.
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (improvements of the code structure).
- perf: A code change that improves the performance.
- test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests.
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, npm).
- ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: travis, circle).
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files.
- revert: Reverts a previous commit.

# **üîó Branches**
1. There must be a `main` branch, used only for the releases.
2. Avoid long descriptive names for long-lived branches.
3. Use kebab-case (no CamelCase).
4. Use grouping tokens (words) at the beginning of your branch names (in a similar way to the `type` of commit).
5. Define and use short lead tokens to differentiate branches in a way that is meaningful to your workflow.
6. Use slashes to separate parts of your branch names.
7. Remove your branch after merging it if it is not important.
**Examples:**
```
git branch -b docs/readme
git branch -b test/a-feature
git branch -b feat/sidebar
git branch -b fix/b-feature
```
