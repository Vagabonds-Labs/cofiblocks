volumes:
  mysql-data:
```
### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vagabonds-Labs/cofiblocks.git
   cd cofiblocks
   ```
   - Run `docker compose up`, to access the database.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Rename
   ```bash
   mv .env.example to .env 
   ```
   **And add this in your .env file:**
      ```bash
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=
      MYSQL_DATABASE=
      MYSQL_USER=
      MYSQL_PASSWORD=
      DATABASE_URL="mysql://${MYSQL_USER}:${MYSQL_PASSWORD
      }@localhost:3306/${MYSQL_DATABASE}?
      connect_timeout=10"
      ```
      **Important:**
      - Add and run `docker compose up` in this part.
4. Generate the Prisma client:
   ```bash
   bun prisma generate
   ```
5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   bun turbo dev
   ```
**Make sure the values in the .env file are configured correctly for your environment.**
### **Project Structure**
The project is organized using workspaces:
- `apps/` - Contains the main web application.
- `packages/` - Shared packages and utilities.

Key scripts include:
- `build`: Build the project.
- `dev`: Start the development server.
- `db:migrate`: Apply database migrations.
- `db:seed`: Seed the database with initial data.

### **Key Technologies**
1. **StarkNet**
   ```bash
   StarkNet is a decentralized, permissionless Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. It uses ZK-STARKs (zero-knowledge proofs) to enable fast and cost-efficient transactions while ensuring security and scalability. Developers can deploy smart contracts, and users benefit from significantly reduced gas fees compared to Ethereum's mainnet.
   ```
2. **Prisma**
   ```bash
   Prisma is a modern database toolkit for Node.js and TypeScript. It provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that simplifies working with databases, allowing developers to define models and query data in a type-safe way. Prisma supports multiple databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB
   ```
3. **Bun**
   ```bash
   Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime that competes with Node.js and Deno. It‚Äôs built for performance and includes a fast bundler, transpiler, and package manager. Bun aims to speed up development workflows, reduce dependency on third-party tools, and execute JavaScript and TypeScript quickly. It‚Äôs designed to handle server-side apps, scripts, and front-end tooling.
   ```
