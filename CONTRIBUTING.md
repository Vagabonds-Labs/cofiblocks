## 🛠 How To Contribute

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account first.

2. Clone the repository in your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cofiblocks.git
cd marketplace
```

2. Create and switch to your branch: 
```bash
git commit -m "[docs]: update documentation"
``` 

```bash
git commit -m "[fix]: fix bug in code"
``` 

```bash
git commit -m "[test]: add test case"
```

# **🔗 Branches**
1. There must be a `main` branch, used only for the releases.
2. Avoid long descriptive names for long-lived branches.
3. Use kebab-case (no CamelCase).
4. Use grouping tokens (words) at the beginning of your branch names (in a similar way to the `type` of commit).
5. Define and use short lead tokens to differentiate branches in a way that is meaningful to your workflow.
6. Use slashes to separate parts of your branch names.
7. Remove your branch after merging it if it is not important.
**Examples:**
```
git branch -b docs/readme
git branch -b test/a-feature
git branch -b feat/sidebar
git branch -b fix/b-feature
```
